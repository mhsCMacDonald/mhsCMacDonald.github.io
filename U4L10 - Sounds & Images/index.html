    <!--This code seems to "call" the sketch.js file, so that other items can be
        placed before and after the sketch.js file, instead of the sketch.js being
        displayed at the end.-->

      <p>I learned to use images and sounds in my p5 programs with the help of Ms. Edwards' lesson and the internet. I also practiced hosting a local server so that the images/audio would work.</p>
      <p>Previously, I looked at Ms. Edward's lesson-website using the "Inspect Element" tool to see how she used HTML. I used this knowledge to make this webpage.</p>
