<!--Modifications to index.html by Charlie.
I reverse-engineered the code from Ms. Edwards' webpages/examples for this assignment.
I created links, headings, a list of bullet points, and changed where sketch.js will appear.

    <h2>Sumnmative - The Ball</h2>
      <p>Here is my summative game. Follow the in-game instructions.</p>
    <div id="call sketch.js"> </div>
    <!--This code seems to "call" the sketch.js file, so that other items can be
        placed before and after the sketch.js file, instead of the sketch.js being
        displayed at the end.-->

      <p>My code:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-Uses if/else statements to make levels - learned from U4L11 decision structures</li>
        <li>-Applies knowledge to make shapes move - learned from "using the keyboard" and "using the mouse"</li>
        <li>-Applies knowledge on using images and sounds from U4L10</li>
        <li>-Makes extensive use of variables and math to control them.</li>
        <li>-Detects collisions between obstacles and the ball.</li>
        <li>-Detects when the ball is clicked using a mouse press check when the two are touching.</li>
      </ul>

      Previously, I looked at Ms. Edward's lesson-website using the "Inspect Element" tool to see how she embedded sketch.js, created text, etc. I used this knowledge for this most index.html files in the Processing unit.<br><br>
