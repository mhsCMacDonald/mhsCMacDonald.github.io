<!--Modifications to index.html by Charlie.
I reverse-engineered the code from Ms. Edwards' webpage for this assignment.
I created links, headings, a list of bullet points, and changed where sketch.js will appear.

    <h2>U4L9 - Using the Keyboard</h2>
      <p>I have created a simple 2 player game. The objective is to reach the side guarded by your opponent.
      Strafe back and forth to confuse your opponent and to get a breakaway.</p>
    <div id="call sketch.js"> </div>
    <!--This code seems to "call" the sketch.js file, so that other items can be
        placed before and after the sketch.js file, instead of the sketch.js being
        displayed at the end.-->

      <p>My code:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows 2 players to accelerate with the WASD/arrow keys</li>
        <li>Stops the game and displays text if a player has won, or restart the game if the mouse is clicked</li>
        <li>Allows the players to bounce off of each other with collideRectRect</li>
        <li>Allows the players to bounce off of walls</li>
        <li>Simultes friction by reducing speed over time</li>
        <li>Prevets players from escaping the playable area by forcing them back in</li>
      </ul>

      I also took a look at Ms. Edward's lesson-website using the "Inspect Element" tool to see how she embedded sketch.js, created text, etc. I used this knowledge for this index.html file.<br>
