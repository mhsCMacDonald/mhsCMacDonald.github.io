    <h1>U4L8 - Using the Mouse - Part 1</h1>
      <p>A shape will follow the mouse in the space below. Click or scroll to change the shapeâ€”no mouse movement required! Also, try clicking and dragging.</p>
    <div id="call sketch.js"> </div>
    <!--This code seems to "call" the sketch.js file, so that other items can be
    placed before and after the sketch.js file, instead of the sketch.js being displayed at the end of the webpage.-->

      <p>My code:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Makes a compound shape that follows the mouse</li>
        <li>Changes the size of the shape when the mouse is scrolled (found the code in the reference manual)</li>
        <li>Allows the shape to change colours rapidly while the mouse is clicked and dragged</li>
        <li>Clears the background so a trail isn't left behind</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I also took a look at Ms. Edward's lesson-website using the "Inspect Element" tool to see how she embedded sketch.js, created text, and created links. I applied this knowledge for this index.html file.</p>
