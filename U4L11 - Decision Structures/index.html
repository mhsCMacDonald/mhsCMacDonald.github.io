    <!--This code seems to "call" the sketch.js file, so that other items can be
        placed before and after the sketch.js file, instead of the sketch.js being
        displayed at the end.-->

      <p>My code:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Has levels for different questions</li>
        <li>Uses variables to display how many quesitons were right at the end.</li>
        <li>Uses if/else if to make decisions (change to next question, count # correct/incorrect) based on user events</li>
      </ul>

      Previously, I looked at Ms. Edward's lesson-website using the "Inspect Element" tool to see how she embedded sketch.js, created text, etc. I used this knowledge for this index.html file.<br>
